Order: 3 Positives / 3 Negatives
----------------------------------

Didn’t expect much, but wow, this movie blew me away. The story felt alive and the ending was perfect.

Slow start, but once it gets going it’s pure magic. Easily one of the best I’ve seen this year.

Great acting, beautiful visuals, and a soundtrack I can’t stop thinking about. Totally worth it.

What a disappointment. Predictable plot and zero chemistry between the leads.

I tried to like it, but the pacing was painful. Felt twice as long as it actually was.

Visually nice, but the story is trash. Style over substance all the way.

This one had me smiling the whole time. Pure fun, no regrets.

Smart writing, clever twists, and performances that stick with you. Loved it.

One of those rare films that makes you think and feel at the same time. Fantastic work.

The trailer promised so much more. What we got was bland and forgettable.

Characters were flat, dialogue felt forced, and by the end I didn’t care at all.

Couldn’t even finish it. A total mess with no direction.

Beautifully shot and emotionally powerful. I’ll be recommending this to everyone I know.

The kind of movie that reminds you why you love cinema in the first place.

Brilliant from start to finish. I wanted to clap when it ended.

Big budget, big names, and still boring. Money can’t buy good storytelling.

Overhyped to the max. Nothing special here at all.

Felt like a parody of itself. Unintentionally funny but mostly just bad.

A perfect mix of heart and humor. Left the theater feeling happy.

Every scene looked like a painting. Absolutely stunning cinematography.

Tense, exciting, and with an ending I didn’t see coming. Loved every minute.

The concept was interesting, but the execution was terrible. Such a waste.

Actors tried, but the script gave them nothing to work with. Boring.

Cheap jump scares and clichés everywhere. Seen this movie a hundred times before.

Hands down one of the most entertaining films I’ve watched in years. A total blast.
